{"tagline":"conference manangement system","body":"# frab - conference management system\r\n\r\nfrab is a web-based conference planning and management system. \r\nIt helps to collect submissions, to manage talks and speakers \r\nand to create a schedule.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThis fork was used for the CCC conference SIGINT12 and is still in active\r\ndevelopment for future conferences.\r\n\r\nfrab was originally created for the organization of FrOSCon 2011 (http://www.froscon.de).\r\nFrOSCon has previously used pentabarf (http://pentabarf.org), and although\r\nfrab is a completely new implementation, it borrows heavily from pentabarf.\r\n\r\nBoth FrOSCon and frab owe a lot to pentabarf. But sadly, pentabarf seems to\r\nbe abandoned. And several problems make it hard to maintain. Thus we decided\r\nto create a new system.\r\n\r\n## Current status\r\n\r\nfrab is under heavy development. There is no stable release yet.\r\nYou may want to try to use frab regardless, but be warned, that it may\r\nbe a rocky ride.\r\n\r\nThat being said, frab has been used to organize FrOSCon 2011, a\r\nconference with more than 100 talks (and as many speakers) in more\r\nthan 5 parallel tracks (plus devrooms) over 2 days.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nfrab is a pretty standard Ruby on Rails (version 3.2) application. \r\nThere should be plenty of tutorials online on how to install,\r\ndeploy and setup these.\r\n\r\nBasically, to get started you need git, ruby (>= 1.9.3) and bundler \r\nand follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1) Clone the repository\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/katastrophie/frab.git\r\n\r\n2) cd into the directory:\r\n\r\n    cd frab\r\n\r\n3) Install all necessary gems:\r\n\r\n    bundle install\r\n\r\n4) Install Imagemagick:\r\n\r\nThis is a dependency of the paperclip gem. Imagemagick\r\ntools need to be installed to identify and resize images.\r\n\r\nImagemagick should be easy to install using your OS's\r\npreferred package manager (apt-get, yum, brew etc.).\r\n \r\n5) Create (and possibly modify) the database configuration:\r\n\r\n    cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml\r\n\r\nfrab bundles all three built-in rails database drivers. \r\nAnd it should work with all three, although it is best tested \r\nwith MySQL and SQLite3 (for development). \r\n\r\n6) Create and modify settings:\r\n\r\n    cp config/settings.yml.template config/settings.yml\r\n\r\n7) Create and setup the database\r\n\r\n    rake db:setup\r\n\r\n8) Precompile assets (only needed for production)\r\n\r\n    rake assets:precompile\r\n\r\n9) Start the server\r\n\r\nTo start frab in the development environment simply run\r\n\r\n    rails server\r\n\r\nTo start frab in the production environment make sure you\r\ndid not skip step 8 and run:\r\n\r\n    rails server -e production\r\n\r\n(Note that for a \"real\" production environment you\r\nprobably do not want to use this script, but rather something\r\nlike unicorn or passenger.)\r\n\r\nNavigate to http://localhost:3000/ and login as \r\n\"admin@example.org\" with password \"test123\".\r\n\r\n## Migrating from pentabarf\r\n\r\nfrab comes with a script that offers limited capabilities of\r\nmigrating data from pentabarf. For it to work, you need access\r\nto pentabarf's database and configure it in config/database.yml\r\nunder the key \"pentabarf\".\r\n\r\nThen simply run\r\n\r\n    rake pentabarf:import:all\r\n\r\nPlease note, that the script has not been tested with HEAD\r\nand will most probably not work. If you still want to try it\r\nout, checkout the code at the revision the script was last\r\nchanged at and upgrade the code and migrate the database\r\nfrom there.\r\n\r\n## Ticket Server \r\n\r\nThis fork supports OTRS and RT ticket servers. Instead of sending \r\nevent acceptance/rejection mails directly to submitters, frab adds\r\na ticket to a request tracker.\r\n\r\nThe ticket server type can be configured in \r\n\r\n    config/initializers/ticket_server_type.rb\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nfrab is licensed under an MIT-License. It bundles some\r\nthird-party libraries and assets that might be licensed\r\ndifferently. See LICENSE.\r\n","name":"Frab","note":"Don't delete this file!
